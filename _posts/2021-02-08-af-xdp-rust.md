# Wat?
So what's this all about anyways?

### Code:

```rust

pub fn main() {
    println!("Something here..");
}

```

Pretty sweet..

> Some interesting quote here..

```rust

enum EnumValue {
    Case1,
    Case2(bool),
    Case3{ x: usize, y: usize },
}

struct Test {
    inner: u32,
    other: Option<EnumValue>,
}

```
